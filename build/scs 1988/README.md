A post season trawl survey was conducted on the Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence between August 5th and October 3rd, 1988. 

A standard 20-meter Nephrops trawl with Scanmar electronic net sensor was used on a chartered vessel for the research survey. 

Stations were sampled on a twelve hour basis during daylight. 

The duration of the tows varied from 4 to 8 minutes at a speed of 2.0-3.5 knots. 

A standard trawl haul starts when the predetermined amount of cable (usually three times the depth) is let out and the winch drums are locked. 

The swept surface by trawl net was estimated from the data on net wing width measured by SCANMAR electronic net sensor

The catch is sorted out by sex,size, morphometric maturity, molt stages and the presence/absence of the external eggs for females .

This year's survey was planned in order to cover as large an area as possible. Therefore the number of tows per 10'x10' grid was limited to one.
